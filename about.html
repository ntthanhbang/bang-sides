                <p>My name is Băng, which means iceberg (isn't that cool?).
                    <br><br>
                    I’ve always been that curious kid who couldn’t stop asking “how?”.
                    Whether it’s tech, science, or something completely random, I love diving into new ideas just to see where they lead (you can obviously tell that I love Christmas).
                    Creativity has always been my favorite tool - especially when it comes to solving tricky problems.
                    <br><br>
                    But as much as I love innovation, I’m equally fascinated by people.
                    Psychology, humanity, what makes us <em>us</em> - that stuff pulls me in every time.
                    Now, I’m on a journey to mix my love for technology and creativity to make the world a little smarter, kinder, and maybe even more fun ;)
